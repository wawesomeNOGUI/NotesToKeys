# NotesToKeys
Play notes -> simulate keypresses

Here's all the code to use in electron/src and I'll add a release which is the NotesToKeysToggle.zip.
Download the NotesToKeysToggle.zip, extract to wherever you'd like, and then navigate into the extracted directory and run my-app.exe
You can customize which notes are bound to which keypresses by editing the NotesToKeys.txt, run my-app.exe, and then drag the NotesToKeys.txt file onto the "choose file" button.
Have fun!
