# NotesToKeys
Play notes -> simulate keypresses

NotesToKeys listens to a user’s microphone and finds what the musical note being played or sung is. Then a user specified key press is executed based on which note was played. 
This program can be used for:
- Playing video games with your instrument or voice
- Typing with your instrument or voice
- Any other fun idea you might have!
